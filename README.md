# Covid-19 Data Exploration using SQL
## Project Overview
* In this project I performed an EDA for the COVID 19 Data for deaths and vaccination. 
* Used Microsoft SQL Server for EDA
* The data is taken from January 2020 - April 2021.
### Findings:
* The highest death percentage for India was on 12/4/2020 being 3.5%. This means that 3 of every 100 people were likely to die due to Covid-19.
* The highest infection rate ever was in a country called Andorra being 17% on 30/4/2021. This means that 17 of every 100 people were likely to be infected by Covid-19.
* The overall highest infection rate WRT population for a country was for Andorra being 17%. The second highest overall infection rate WRT population for a country was for Montenegro being 15%.
* The highest overall death count for a country was for United States being 5,75,232.
* If we break things by continents the highest death count was for North America.
* The total cases for the whole world were 15,05,74,977 while the total death count was 31,80,206 and the overall death percentage was at 2.11%.
* **Joining** the Vaccination and Death tables we found out that the highest single day vaccination count was in Thailand being 99,985. We also used the **window** function to record a running people vaccinated count.
